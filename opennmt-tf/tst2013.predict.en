when I was a kid , I thought perhaps I was the best country in the world , and I would love the song , " We have no envy . "
I was so proud of my country .
in school , we 've spent a lot of time learning about the life of the president of Venus : unionseek , but we don 't learn a lot about the outside world , except where the United States , Korea and Japan is our enemy .
even though I had wondered how the world was out there , but I still thought I would live the life of the end of the year , until all of the sudden change .
when I was seven , I watched people do the first ever open record in their life , but I still thought my life was just perfect .
my family 's not poverty , and I myself have never been in support .
but on one day of 1995 , my mother brought home a letter from a sister and a mother came home with a mother .
it said , when you read these lines , they were even the five people they were not killed anymore , because the whole family had nothing to eat in two weeks .
all that lay on the floor , and our body just comes down so far as the dead was coming off .
I was shocked .
because that 's the first time that I know that my people are suffering .
shortly after , when I went to a gas station , I saw a horror picture that I could never forget .
on the gas floor is the dead minister of a two - year - old woman who is self - given a short child , and the child just tries to stare at her face .
but nobody is helping them , because they 're all having to worry about themselves and all the family .
in the mid - 90s , North Korea had this massive famine .
it makes more than a million more Korean people die in hunger , and a lot of people survived the grass , the beetles and the plant .
the electron was happening too often , so everything around me was dark at night to the dark , except for the light from the Chinese point of my house .
I always wonder why they have the power of us .
this is a photograph from the supposed satellite of North Korea during the night of relation to the countries around .
this is the philodendron selloum between North Korea and China .
it can see the river so narrow , so some North Koreans are coming out to China .
but a lot of people died .
and I saw the bodies of the river .
I can 't speak particularly about how I have been hiding from North Korea in a way that was difficult to say that , within years , I was sent to China to a long - away person .
I just thought I 'd have to go a little too long away from my family .
rather than I could ever imagine that I would have to take them for a long time .
in China , the life of a young girl who was detached from her family like I was difficult .
I had no idea what happened to the life of a refugees from North Korea was like , but I realized how early it was not hard , but it was too dangerous , because the refugees coming out of North Korea in China were considered to be the illegal immigrants .
I always lived in a fear that I had the privilege that I could find , and I was paying back to the old life in North Korea .
one day , that nightmare was truth , I was getting Chinese police and made me to the police station for the matter .
somebody told them that I 'm North Koreans , so they tested my Chinese language and asked me a lot of questions .
I was so scared , and there was a feeling like my heart was going out .
because if they saw anything unnatural , I would get taken to jail and have a return return to the water .
I think my life is to end , but I still try to control my emotions and answer their questions .
after we 've got that done , one of the two police speaks to the other , this is just another one .
it 's not a North Koreans . "
and they release me . that 's a miracle .
there are some North Koreans in China who have come to the foreign domination to get to refugees , but a lot of them have been caught by the Chinese police , and got paid back to water .
these girls were very lucky .
because although we 've been arrested , we can eventually learn from the international community .
but these North Koreans are not so fortunate .
there are a number of North Koreans that are caught in China , and was paid to return to the water , where they were tortured , or executed clothes .
while I was very lucky to be released , a lot of my people weren 't .
North Korea had to cut off their identity and try to survive the thing as a tragedy .
even though they 've studied Chinese and found a job , their lives can be completely out of a moment .
which is why after the 10 years of rejection , I decided to go to South Korea in order to start another life once again .
settling down here was far more difficult than I imagined .
because in Korea , English had a very important position , so I started to study English , my third language .
I also learned an enormous distance between the South and North Korea .
we were all North Koreans , but got very different , because the year was separated .
I was going through a crisis of my origins .
I 'm a North Koreans or North Korea ?
where do I come from ? and who am I ?
suddenly , I had no country to be proud of the country .
and although I should adapt to the lives of South Korea , it is not easy , but I made a plan .
and we started learning to prepare for college .
and yet , as soon as I 've just gotten to know things about life there , I am told the horror .
the North Korea government found out how much money I sent to my family , and , to punish myself , they 'd get my family loose in rural areas .
so that they can go out very quickly , I started to plan my family to escape .
North Koreans have had to overcome gaps that seemed to be free .
because the thing which was crossing from North Korea was kind of impossible , so I had to fly to China and go back to the north border of North Korea .
because my family doesn 't know Chinese , so I have to go and see people over 2 , 000 miles in China and go to the South Asia .
this was on a bus for about a week , and it was just a couple of times we got arrested .
once , our cars were stopped and were discovered by a Chinese police officer .
he recorded the letter of everybody , and started asking questions .
because my family doesn 't understand Chinese , so I thought they were going to be arrested .
when the Chinese police came to them , I immediately stood up and said to him , these are just the deaf people that I was going to go in .
he looks at me completely suspicious , but fortunately , he believed me .
and we went on to the border of Laos , and I have had to use almost all the money that I have to pay for people with their border guards anyway .
however , after we got past borders , my family was arrested to jail for crime .
after I submitted tickets and gave bribes , my family was released in one month , and then arrested again in the capital of Laos .
it was the most despair moment in my life .
I 've done all kinds of ways to bring my family into freedom , and we 've become almost good , but they 're arrested while we 're just , in very short distances .
I went back to the middle of the room and the police walls , and I was hoping to find a way to get my family out , but I didn 't have enough money to pay a bribe anymore .
I was so desperate .
and at that point , a man asked me , " What is this ? "
I was incredibly surprised when someone wholly irredeemable of the question .
through his tiny little set of English and a dictionary , I told him the circumstances of my family . just a little bit of an address , the man was going to go to the ATM machine . pay out all the funds of my family and two North Koreans to get out of .
I 'd thank you to my whole heart , and I said , " Why are you helping me ? "
" I didn 't help her , " He replied .
" I 'm saving North Koreans . "
I realized that was a huge moment of meaning in my life .
the kindness from a stranger man who was so far from just gave me the new hope to and yet the North Koreans when we 're due , and he showed me a great deal out of strangers and the international community was the hope that the North Koreans do .
and , after a long journey , and my family has been reunited in South Korea , but to come up with my freedom , only half of the struggle .
a lot of North Koreans are separated from their families , and when they come to a different country , they start with very little or pretty much money .
so we can get help from international community support to education , teach English , and so on .
we can also act as the bridge between people who are in North Korea with the outside world , because there are so many people of us who are keeping contact with other family members in the country , and we share with them information and money to change North Korea from within .
I was incredibly fortunate to have a lot of help and be inspired by my life , so I wanted to be able to bring strength to my country an opportunity to grow with international support .
I believe that you will see more and more North Koreans than in the world , including on the TED stage .
thank you .
I just have one request today .
don 't tell me I 'm okay .
now I want to introduce you to my older brothers .
CE : the 22 years old , height and a beautiful man .
I don 't say it , but I put my joy in ways that even some of the best heroes can 't do it .
Forty - known love .
he shared it in an almost infinite way .
he didn 't greedy . he did not differentiate and color .
I 'm not interested in the religious differences , and let 's understand : he never made a lie .
when I 'm singing songs from our childhood , trying to remember the words that I can 't , she reminds me of something that we know about how little brains get , and what we don 't know yet how wonderful they are .
Samuel is 16 years old . he 's very beautiful .
you have a perfectly fine memory .
but they are .
she doesn 't remember whether she had a gyre of candy - - my wife - - or she remembered , when the song of every song on my iPod , the talks between us came from four - year - old , pee on my hands on the first day , and the birthday of Lady Gaga .
these are listening beautiful , isn 't it ?
but most people don 't agree .
and the fact that because our minds are not suitable to make of the normal society , they 've often been oblivious and the false understanding .
but what really causes my heart to get better and my soul is that , even though this is true , even though they are not supposed to be normal , it can mean that they are extraordinary - - people are autistic .
for you , it 's not too familiar with the phrases of autism , but it 's a brain disorder that deals with social communications , education , and sometimes even at the frontiers of our physical lives .
the disease in each individual , is the reason why it 's so different than Sam .
and all around the globe , there 's 20 minutes of one person who 's diagnosed with autism , and even though it 's one of the world 's fastest problems , we 're not rational or treatment .
and I can 't remember the first time that I 'd have with autism , but I can 't remember one day without it .
I was three years old when my baby was born and I was very excited to have a new person in my life .
and after a few months , I realized that you 're different .
he yelled out for a lot .
she didn 't want to play as any of the other children , and in fact , she wasn 't really interested in me or something else .
Bettie and the politics of my own world , with my own rules , and she has found joy in the smallest of things , like setting the car around in the room and staring at whatever the washing machine should be .
as I grew older , I became more different , and the difference became more apparent .
but beyond the anger and the anger and the mimic and the fact that there 's something really unique : an pure and naive , a boy who looks at his life with no opinion , a person who never gets to lie .
Africa stands .
well , I can 't deny that there were some tough moments in my family , the moments that I would wish them to be similar to me .
but I took my memory back to what they taught me about personality and communication and love , and I realized that these are the things that I won 't change for the normal .
often missed our beauty and the difference between us and our understanding is that one of us is just wrong .
it just means there 's a different ' worth .
and if I can only pass one thing to come to Sam and tell you , it 's not that you 're supposed to be regular .
you can be incredible .
because with autism , there is a difference between us - - we 've got a gift ! everyone is with us , and honestly , chasing the normal thing is to sacrifice the biggest potential .
opportunity for excellence , progress and for change being turned off when we try to become more like somebody else .
don 't - - don 't tell me I 'm okay .
thank you .
maybe you 'll all agree with me and this is a beautiful road .
it 's built out of sugar , and a street plastic is a car that runs on it , which is very smooth , but not always gets , especially when it 's old today .
then you get water on the highway .
and especially if you take a bike ride , and it gets through those cars , it 's not .
and also , tobacco causes a lot of noise .
it 's an extra piece of content , if we do those paths like the Netherlands , we are very close with cities , we want a static road .
the solution to the problem is to make the streets out of plastic .
plastic is what we 're doing now to build most of the countries in the Netherlands , it has holes , and it passes that water as only through the hole , so all the rain is going to get out , and you have a pathway by which you can drive on a car , so you don 't have a stigma .
and noise just disappears through the tap .
because it 's empty , the whole noise will disappear , so the path is very quiet .
of course there are still so many emotions , and the impossible of this line is the situation when you find out , how do you happen .
what is the broken bubble ? you see it on the way here we saw it on the street here is the floating through .
first , you get a rock , and more , and more , and more , more , more , and then - - There I won 't do that .
but they can break your car window , so you 're not happy with that .
and after all , the more burst of these cracks will fail more and more .
sometimes they build chicken nuggets .
Oh , he 's ready .
the chicken , of course , can become a problem , but we have it .
actually , as you can see here , that material is very destructive .
it 's a plastic polymer , as I said , you only have a small amount of glue between a rock .
under the impact of the weather , the solar panels , the chemical scum , and this plastic oxygen could , which is this collagen , and that 's in turn , and if it 's , it will have these little cracks in the form , and if it 's going to have its small cracks .
and if you drive across the road , you end up destroying these bonds - - as we just saw here .
to address this problem , we created smart materials .
if we can create this self - assemble materials , we can find a solution .
what we can do is we can use the bulk of the steel hoop up , and we can put the mess in a small shadow , and we can split this tiny fragment of the nitrogen with a picnic .
and so we have a plastic mixed in those very small steel debris .
and you need a machine , like you can see here , which is the printer - - a sensors machine from this .
this internal sensing is very , and especially steel is very good .
what you 're doing is to heat up the plastic , you 're doing the plastic , and the plastics are coming to these little cracks , and the stones will stick to the top .
today I was using a wave , because I couldn 't get the camera from a bulky tube , and I could not take the camera from a bulky stage .
the reactor also has the same working system .
I put the object into the oven , and I 'm going to take it out . let 's see how it goes .
this is the material that 's out .
I told us that we invented a industrial machine in the lab , so we can heat the materials .
and at the lab , we tried many samples , and then the government , they really saw the results , and they said , " Well , well , we have to try this . "
and so they gave us a piece of the country that showed us , 400 meters long on the mainland , where we had to build a piece of material experiment .
so that 's what we 've been doing here . you look at the way we tried to do it , and then , of course , this path will last for many years without any damage . that 's what we 've learned from practice .
we 've taken samples from this road and we tried them in the lab .
so we grow the prototype , we put the molecule on it , we put it back with a sensor from , and then we try it out again .
we can do that many times .
and really , the conclusion that comes from this study is that , if we protect the four years at a time with a joint device - - this is a large version of the size that we 've created it to maintain the real road - - if you ask four years to give a daily act .
well , in order to re - wrap up , I can tell you that we 've created a materials that use steel , add in addition to steel fiber , using heat , to actually increase the lifespan of the road , twice the amount of life expectancy , even if you can do it , double the amount of survival .
now I 'm sure you 're wondering whether it works .
we 've got the prototype here . it 's pretty warm .
it 's supposed to let it cool down , and then I show you the effects of a successful treatment .
but let me try that .
Hey . yeah , it 's the newspaper .
thank you .
I 'm here to talk to you today about a complex question that answers don 't smell bad .
well , the subject is the secret to post violence , and the question I ask is , why does she always ask the question ?
why should women be staying with them ?
I 'm not a psychiatrist , not a social workers or a domestic expert .
I 'm just a woman who wants to share her story .
and I was 22 , and I graduated from Harvard College .
I moved to New York City when I was doing the first job writing and editing the society for a moment .
for the first time I had apartments , my American Express card , and I had big secret .
the secret is , this gun is being loaded up to the side of the house by my man who I thought his partner was from , over and over again .
the man I fell in love with all people put a gun to my head and threatening to kill me how often I don 't remember them .
so I 'm here to tell you about the crazy love , a psychological trap with the skin in the face of the millions of women and even some men having to own a year .
this could be your story .
I don 't look like a family violence .
I have an English staff from Harvard Business School , and the marketing manager from the city was speaking .
I worked out of my real career working for companies in the top 500 of the U . S . - - like marriage and Mr . Shaileshkumar Washington .
I married my second husband who was nearly 20 years married and had three children together .
my dog is kind of like the Black Box , and I took the centipede .
so , the first thing I want to tell you is that violence is happening to everyone in the world , every religion , every level of income and education .
it happens everywhere .
and the second thing that I want to talk about is that people think , prefer violence - - is the problem of women .
right .
over 85 percent of the violence is men , and the family violence takes place only in intimate contact , tied , long - term relations , in other words , in the family , where we want to see , or in watch the violence is a cause of violence in the presence of trouble .
I told myself , I was the other person on Earth who lived with the man who beat me , but actually , I am a typical victim of my age .
I 'm only 22 years old , living in the United States , women between 16 and 24 have a chance on the earth struggle of violence against women in other age , and over 500 women and girls at this age are killed every year by the violence , your boyfriend , your son , and his husband in America .
I was a typical victim because I had no idea what violence or its prototype .
I met the house in a January , the rain and cold .
he sat beside me in a New York City subway , and he began talking to me .
he told me about two things .
so one is that he , like me , just like me , graduated from the University of Africa and that he worked at a very impressive bank on Wall Street .
but the most remarkable thing to me at the first encounter was that he was smart just fun and kind of looked like a farmer .
he has this big look inside here , and he has this big flash of insight and the hair that was so warm and so forth , and he seems so sweet .
one of the most intelligent things in the world , from the beginning of the day is to create a kind of hallucination that I was with a full - time connection .
he was doing this in the first place by religion to me .
we started out dating , and he loved me every single aspect that I thought I was intelligent , that I went to Harvard , that I was the heat to help women who had adults and work .
he wanted to know everything about my family and about my childhood , my hopes and dreams .
to believe me , like a writer and a woman in a way that no one has ever had .
and he also creates the magic atmosphere of trust among us by taking his secrets out of his , that he 's as a child that , since the age of four has been used to treat his body evil , and yet his father , who has become very bad at the end of his age of eight , to lose his history .
and why that explains why the degrees in so far and the work at the Wall Street and the bright future he has huge meaning for him .
if you tell me that a smart man , this funny , sensitive man , who I 'd rather have this day at night when I got to the point or not , my dress is up , where I live , where do things , who is my friend and where I am , where is when I was going to cheat , I 'm not ?
I didn 't know that for the first stage in any kind of family violence relationship to lust and anxiety .
I don 't know the second stage was the alone .
now , brrrrrrrrrr , head home a day and announced that , " Hey , you know , all the game like Romeo and Juliet is great , but I had to move to the next stage where I had to put her home — " — " so I needed to get her out of this apartment where you would have heard from .
instead of England , putting home on a Friday night and he told me that he was working on this day job , and he said , he quit my job because I made him feel secure and loved that he wasn 't having to show me how small he would put his way back to the town .
now , the last thing I 'd like to do is to leave New York City and my dream , but I thought I had to give you my life , so , I agreed and take my life off , and let me take my life as a chance , and let me out of Manhattan .
I don 't think I 've had a crazy love , that I was walking the first few steps into a psychological trap , money and I 've known to be careful .
the next step in this violence scenario was to put into a violence threat and see how she responded .
from now on , the gun goes in .
when we moved to New England - - you know , where we were doing this to feel safe - - he bought three guns .
he has one plant in the space of our car .
so , this is the one on our sleeping bed .
and he says that he needed these guns because the damage he had passed through was a child .
he needed them to be preserved .
but these shots are actually a message for me , and even though he doesn 't have their hands right on me , my life at risk at once every single day .
quads were attacked me five days ago at our wedding .
it was at seven o 'clock in the morning when I was wearing my pajamas .
I 'm iO Tillett inside , and I 'm trying to become the post - adopted article and I get my depression , and I 'm trying to capture two hands in my neck and suck across my neck , and he can 't breath or scream , and he uses my way onto the wall constantly .
five days later , I saw the bruise on my neck , and I saw my mother 's dress , and I got married .
so , despite everything that happened , I 'm still sure we 're going to live happily because I love him and I love me too much .
and he was terribly wrong .
he was so nervous about married and married and getting married with me .
it 's an individual trying , and he will never hurt me again .
it happened twice a week in the passwords .
for the first time , I was driving to find a secret beach and I was lost , and he was beating me on a side of my head so hard , and so on .
a few days later , when he was driving home after the moon , he was tired by cars , and he throws a box off to my face .
the vice versa beat me up one to two times a week in the following two months after I got married .
I was wrong to think that I am the only case and that I am single in this .
one third of the American women has come through domestic violence or encountered during some stage life and the CDC report of 15 million children being abused every year , 15 million .
so I 'm actually in a really good company .
back to my question : why am I here ?
very easy answers .
I don 't know he 's working on me .
and even he pointed to me , putting me down on the floor , threatened to kill my dog , which pulled me out of the car before I was driving to the high road , without having my hat on my back when I was wearing the exam on my interview , I never once thought to be an wife who was arrested .
instead , I was a strong woman in love with a man who had trouble , and I was the only person on Earth who could encounter his ugly card .
the other question that people ask is , why hasn 't she left out ?
why didn 't I walk ? I can leave whenever .
for me , it was the most frightening and most painful question , because we know something else you don 't know : it 's a terrible danger to get away from a violent rider .
because the last step in the family play was to kill her .
over 70 percent of all domestic violence takes place after the victim ends up having a relationship , after she left , because then the violence man ran away .
but the other thing that happens is that , as long as we 've been monitoring , even after the abuse of married abuse ; the trade of the entire family system to horrific fear victims and her children , these children are sometimes forced by the end of our time to being monitored by the artist .
and we keep asking , why doesn 't she take away ?
I was able to walk away , because the last violent shake had beaten my way .
I realized that my man was so loving would kill me if I left him .
so I broke silence .
I tell them how , the neighbors , my neighbors , my friends and family , who are totally foreign , and I 'm here today because you 're helping me .
we have the notion of the victims as the scary headlines , and women destroy ourselves , the good things that hurt .
and the question , " Why is she sitting around ? "
and the reason for some people , " These are her mistakes when you 're back " as if the victim choice to love you .
but since I came out of " The Meatrix , " I 've heard hundreds of stories from men and women who are too much left , who have learned a lesson in life of worthless but that have happened , and people have built our lives - - happy , happy lives - - like the people , our mothers who are not .
because the truth is that I am a typical German victim who ended up walking me to be a typical - life survivor .
I married a man with a wise and good man , and we had three children .
I have a black dog model , and I have a dress .
what I never had half , ever been a column to my head with someone who said he loved me .
right now , you might be thinking , " Oh , this is great , " or , " Oh , you 're not going to be like , " but all this time , I 've really talked about you .
I 'm sure you 've heard me mention some of the people who are being abused , or some of the people who 've been through your childhood or on your own .
the abuse can influence your daughter , your best friend right now .
I can finish my crazy love by reducing the silence .
I am devastated the silence today .
this is how I help other victims , and this is my final request .
so let 's talk about what you 've heard here .
the virtue is only frightening in silence .
you 're powerful to end the violence simply by adding a light bulb .
we need victims to focus everyone .
we need you to understand the secret violence .
microscopy for the light grace of today by your children , your colleagues , your friends and your family .
they wrote back to their lives like happy people , loving the future .
knowing those early signs of violence and the lying there , falling down , just for the victims who were safe .
together we can get our bed for our wedding tables and our families get quiet and safe island .
thank you .
I want to talk to you about a group of animals that are very special .
there are about 10 , 000 species of birds in the world .
praxeology is one of the most endangered bird groups .
when you see a blink like this , the first thing that comes out in your head is , these are animals that are really ugly , buying and vision for you , dealing with politicians .
I want to change that perception . I want to change the feelings you 're giving to these birds , because they need our compassion . they really need .
let me tell you why .
first , why are they so bad ?
when Charles Darwin went over the Pacific as to meet the Bee locations , he saw these Turkish pigeons , and he said , " Well , these birds are really disgusting for the red head that 's created for a cheer in queen .
you can 't be more expensive than that , and those are words that Charles Darwin .
you know , he changed the opinion when he came back , and I told you why .
they 're also linked to Disney - - as a result of a stupid characters , a bit dumb .
over here , if you 're watching the news in Kenya - - these are the characteristic properties that connect with the basics , but I want to contrast that out .
I 'd like to resist , because you know what ?
because the police don 't have a fresh environment .
the police don 't help prevent the spread of disease .
they almost can 't build a wife - - a husband .
they were going extinct soon .
and , what I like about most , what I like with , the orangutan looked more than a lot .
there were two kinds of Dannys on this planet .
the new wonders have been found mainly in the United States , like the Appalachians , has been found , where , you know , about 16 . in these 16 species , there is an 11 species in response to the extreme risk .
so , why did these things be important ? first of all , they were providing essential ecosystems . they cleaned up .
they 're really natural burials .
they remove the dead bodies to the bone .
they have done this to kill bacteria and they can keep the anthrax in which it can spread and cause these huge losses to different animals .
the latest studies have shown that in these areas that don 't have designed the death threshold of three to four times in order to biodegrade , and this huge result is the spread of disease .
Foldit also had a grand history of their importance .
they were combined with the ancient Egyptians culture .
it 's the symbol of the security and the mother 's love , and it 's with the tiger , it represents the fusion of the bottom - and - of - Egypt .
in the Hindu nerve , he 's got to do this , and he 's been running over to save women 's house in the first place .
in the culture of Tibet , they make the most important burial , in places like Tibet , there 's no place to buried , or there 's no wood to light them , so the ants that build a natural waste of nature .
so , what are the hell ?
we had these 8 races species in Kenya , in which six endangered species .
the reason is that they 're poisoned , they 're poisoned by our human life fighting in human beings and the wild worlds in our communities are using this toxic to in our predator animals but instead , our playfulness encounter is our victims .
in South Asia , countries like India and Pakistan , four crack species were recorded in the list of these super negative risks - - and that means they 're less than 10 or 15 years of reaching this extinct level , and the reason is because they were transformed into a predator because they were being replaced by their way .
this drug was banned in health care in India ; it shows that they 've proven to be used .
since there were no number of fabulous dogs , there were these damaged dogs in the areas of the animals that - - when you have a wild dog , you have a huge explosion in cases of wild - - there were plenty of cases in India .
Kenya will have the largest wind in Africa , with the motors that will be built in the cinema .
I 'm not against wind power , but we need to collaborate with government , because the wind causes birds to make these . they cut off .
they were the bird suits .
in West Africa there is a terrible operation to treat the magic market and decay .
so what did we do ? we 've been doing research on these birds . we 're putting our signals in them .
we 're trying to identify their basic ecology , and track where they come in .
we can see them move to a variety of different countries , so if you focus on issues at the regional scale , it won 't help you at all .
we need to work with government at a regional level .
we 're working with local communities .
we were talking to them about importance the importance of what we had with these amazing animals and the benefits that they had .
how do you help ? you 're able to be an active , creating a voice . you can write a letter to your government and tell them we need to focus on these de - extinction creatures that run a little bit by Taiwan messages .
when you walked out of this room , you had this information about the scenes , but look at your family , say , " Whoa , dad . "
they 're amazing . Charles Darwin said that he changed the opinion because he saw them flying a little bit of hate power in the sky .
Kenya , the world , is much worse without these incredible species .
thank you very much .
when I was 11 years old , I remember one morning I woke up when I heard of an grace in my house .
my dad was listening to the news in the BBC at a little gray radio .
he actually raises a very large smile , and it 's very awkward because the news usually makes him feel very sad .
he brought it up : " the Taliban 've gone ! "
and I don 't really understand , but I can see that my father was very , very happy .
" now I can actually go to school , " he said .
one morning I couldn 't forget .
true school .
you know , the Taliban came to see Afghanistan since I was six years old and stopped the girls in school .
for the next five years , I was dressed as a boy to come to me to a secret school because my sister was banned from my home .
it 's the only way for us to go to school .
every day , we go in a different way so that no one has any questions about our destination .
we were hiding the books in the perimeter of the community , that people would think we would just go shopping .
that school was in a home , more than 100 of us were crammed into a small living room .
pretty warm up in the winter , but summer is extremely hot .
we all know that we 're at risk taking our own lives , our parents and our parents .
there are a couple of times , the school suddenly perfectly closed about a week because the Taliban suspect .
we always wondered what they know about us .
are we being watched ?
do they know where we were ?
we were scared , but still , we wanted to go to school .
I am very lucky to be raised in a very supportive family of importance to education and girl .
my grandfather was an incredible person .
and he was totally out of a distance in Afghanistan , and he insisted that my daughter , my mother was in school , and so he was quit .
but my mother had a teacher .
here she is .
she retired two years ago to use our home to open school for girls and women in her neighborhood .
and this is my father 's first in his family to educate .
he has no doubt that his daughter will be educated , although his daughter , regardless of his Taliban , and despite his danger .
to him , she doesn 't learn to be a greater threat .
now , in the Taliban , I remember that there were times when I was so angry about our lives and so fear and never saw a future .
and I 'd love to get out of studying , but my father , he 'd say , " Listen , this girl can lose everything you 've ever had in this life . "
kids can be taken off . I can be forced to leave the house during the war .
but the one thing that will forever exist with our kids is this place , and if we 're forced to sell blood to a major ticket , we will .
so , you want to go further ?
I 'm 22 .
I grew up in a country that was destroyed by decades of war .
less than six percent of my older women were in high school , and if my family had no longer committed to my education , I was also one of them .
but , I 'm afraid to stand here is a graduate student .
when I came back to Afghanistan , my grandfather , my grandfather , who was rejected by his family because he dare to take his daughter away , was one of the first people to salute me .
he 's not only showing off my college , but I 'm the first woman , and I 'm the first woman to be able to drive him on the streets of Kabul .
my family believed me .
I dream big , but my family wanted to give me even bigger .
so I am the global mission , which is in the global stadium , which is the global movement for women education .
so I helped set up the house , the first school and really was the only thing for the girl in Afghanistan , a country that was still dangerous for girls to go to school .
I 'm very excited to see my biology to my field and to take that chance .
and I saw their parents and their fathers as my father , support them , regardless of them , even if you 're having trouble .
it 's as Ahmed . it 's not the real name of his , and I can 't show it to him , but Ahmed .
less than a month , he and his daughter were on the sidewalk to their village , and they were actually just killed by a bomb bomb only for a few minutes .
when he first came home , the electric telephone , which threatened him if he continues to bring his daughter to school , they 'll try again .
and he said , " If you want to kill me , I 'm not going to ruin my child 's future for evil ideas and backwards from people 's lives . "
now I 've noticed about Afghanistan , and this is what usually leaves out in the West , which is behind almost every single person who deserves our value , and their people find their own success .
this is not saying that mother is not important in our success .
in fact , they were the first and the negotiating of this high future for their daughters , but in this social situation , we needed to support the support of men .
under the Taliban , women coming to an entire hundred people remember , it 's illegal .
but today , more than three million girls are in Africa .
Afghanistan looked different from the U . S .
I found out that Americans see vulnerability and fragility and change .
I was afraid those changes won 't last after the U . S . military got there .
but when I went back to Afghanistan , when I saw my students in my school and my parents supported them , encouraged them , I saw a promising future and the change would be for a long time .
for me , Afghanistan is a country of hope , the inability to limit , and every day of feminism is reminds me of that .
like me , they had big dreams .
thank you .
Hi . this is my cell phone .
a cell phone can change your life , and a cell phone can give you private freedom .
with a cell cell phone , you can record the Afghan human rights movements in Syria .
you could post a cell phone , you could post a message on stress and start having a government protest in Egypt .
and also with a cell phone that you can write a song , put it up on and become famous .
those are all possible with your cell phone .
I 'm a child of 1984 , and I live in the city of Berlin .
let 's go back to that same time , at the city .
you can see here how thousands of people stand up and perform a demonstration of change .
that 's at the fall of 1989 , and imagine those people who got up and exhibit the whole change that would have a cell phone in their pocket .
who in the room have a cell phone ?
raise it .
raise your cell phone , raise your phone bar .
so let 's raise it up . a Android phone , longevity , wow .
a lot . today , most of us have a cell phone .
but today I 'm going to talk about myself and my phone , and how it changed my life .
I 'm going to talk about that .
there 's a gap in exchange .
so the pure information .
but why is that information so here ?
the reason why this is because in the summer of 2006 , the European Union proposes a direct market .
it 's called the dataset .
this shows that every single Internet company in Europe , every Internet service provider in Europe , has to store vast amounts of information about its users .
who was a call for ? who sent somebody an email ?
who sent a mobile message ?
and if you use cell phones , that 's where the problem exists .
all of this information is saved at least in six months , until two years of your home , or the Internet service provider .
and all around Europe , people got up and said , " We don 't want it . "
they said , we don 't want this personal information storage .
we want to have autonomy at the digital age , and we don 't want it to be that companies today and Internet service provider store all our information .
they 're lawyers , journalists and fathers and fathers , all say , " We don 't want it . "
and you can see here , like 10 , 000 people on the streets of Berlin and it had spread , " freedom . "
and some people even said , it 's like two . 0 .
RealTimeWWII is an active police force in Eastern Germany .
I used to ask myself , do it work ?
can they record all our information ?
whenever we use our cell phones ?
and so I asked my home to use my house , DARwIn I was using the largest telecom provider in Germany at the time , and I asked them , please , to send me all the information they had stored .
I asked them to send me one last time , and I then kept on asking , but what I knew was an answer that didn 't have been clear .
but then I said , I want to get this information , because they 're saving my life .
and I decided I would send the one , because I wanted to get the information .
but the tantrum , what we won 't give you these information .
and eventually , I had a deal with them .
I 'm going to break the lawsuit , and they 're going to give me the information I asked .
because at the time , the federal constitution was so promising that it was just market by the European Union system , there was no power in the German constitution .
so I got this really awful brown envelope with a CD of a CD on the inside .
and on the CD , which I need is recorded there .
RealTimeWWII is the communication .
first I look at that , and I say , okay , it 's a big file . good data .
but then I realized , this is my whole life .
this is my six month 's life , which is recorded down the whole file file .
and then I wondered , so what should I do with it ?
because I can see where I got there , where I sleep every night , what I did .
but then I said , I want to public this information .
I wanted it to be known by the public .
because I wanted to show you what the data exploration really is .
so for PROTECTIP , which is itself off — and — I 'm also doing the same thing .
these are the images of my life of the six months that have been recorded .
you can zoom in or replicate it , you can also look backwards or faster on the front .
you can see my step .
you can even know how I got to put myself in the pajamas and ship to get the way , and the frequency I would order to get the contact between those two places .
it 's all possible with this information .
I had a little fear .
but it wasn 't just about me .
it 's information about us all .
first of all , it only looked like this , I called my wife and she called me , and we spoke to each other three times .
and then some friends call me , they call each other .
then after a while you call you , and you call you , and you 're going to have this vast network of communication .
but you can see how we communicate with each other , what they call them , when they go to bed .
you can see it all .
you can see the key parts , like the leaders in a group .
if you have access to this information , you can see the action of the community , the society .
if you have access to this information , you can control the entire society .
this is a drawing for countries like China or Iran .
and this is a way to look at society , because , you know who people talk to , who did send emails , and that could all be done if you had access to this information .
and this information is stored in at least six months in Europe , up until two years .
as I said , when I start , imagine if all of these guys on the street here in 1989 have a cell phone in your pocket .
and perhaps we should know , because who 's been involved in this demonstration , and if you have been told by somebody who 's the leader behind it , it 's probably never going to be able to happen .
the falling of the Berlin Wall is probably not going to exist .
and if so , perhaps the collapse of the iron within the Cold War also would not exist .
because today , function and companies want to capture the information they have on you get more and better , both online and diplomacy .
they want to be able to track our lives , and so they want to again this information at all times .
freedom and living in the digital age , there 's no conflict .
what you should do is stand up for your own autonomy today .
and you have to fight it endlessly every day .
then , when you go home , tell your friends that privacy is a value of the 21st century , and it doesn 't happen .
when you go home , talk to just your representatives , because companies and function can capture that specific information , even though they don 't have to do that .
and if you don 't believe me , ask the web to provide the information they 've stored about .
so , in the future , whenever you use your cell phone , let 's remind you that you should fight for self - interest in this digital age .
thank you .
photography is my passion since I 've grown enough to pick up a camera , but today I want to share with you the 15 pictures that I value , and I 've not taken any one of them .
there 's no arts director , there 's no creator , no toilets , and there 's no interest in light .
in fact , most of them were taken by random visitors .
the story begins when I got to the city of New York to participate in an expression and my wife took me to hold of my daughter 's baby on its first birthday , we came in a corner of 57 and 5 .
we happened to go back to New York just a year later , so we decided to take another one .
you can see where this story goes .
when I came to my third birthday , my wife said , " Why haven 't you arrived in New York doing a travel trip for only my father and daughter , and then going on , " same rituals ? "
since then we start to travel by our way to travel .
you know , to pick your camera on an entirely distant person around the world , secretly .
no one 's denial , and fortunately , there 's no one running on our camera .
we had no idea how that journey was going to change our life .
it became really sacred to us .
this was taken a couple weeks after 9 / 11 , and I was trying to explain what happened on that day in the ways that a five - year - old kid could understand .
these pictures are not just objects represent a moment , or a particular trip .
it 's how we stop time in a weekend of October , our thinking about our time and how we change every year , not just physically , but emotionally .
because although we took the same picture , my opinion changed , my daughter got new set of points , and I saw my life through her eyes , how she was looking and interacting with things .
this time that we 've been focusing on each other is something that we value and expect all the years .
more recently , on a journey , we 've walked , my daughter 's suddenly stops in the middle of the road , and it 's just a red cover of the concrete department that she likes very small as a kid on our recent voyage .
and she described to me how she felt , at the age of five , when she was on that position .
it said that she remembered her heart had gone out of the chest when they saw the store for the first time nine years .
and now what it saw in New York was the university schools , because it decided to go to school in New York .
and I realized : one of the most important things that we create is memory .
so I 'd like to share the ideas that have this central role in creating memories .
I don 't know about how you do it , but in the 15 pictures , I don 't show a lot of them .
I 've always been a photographer .
so today I want to encourage you all to get into the photo , and don 't worry about somebody somewhere , and ask , " Do you take a picture that helps us ? "
thank you .
I never forget the words I told her - - I 've ever come to her life in the forgive : " Hey come , fight , let 's fight me against you .
but never make up a kind of networking . "
nearly two years have passed since the Mother 's Day was out of Libya , and it was entered by the news waves at the wide variety of events in Tunisia and Egypt .
I entered the force in and outside Libya to call the day of extremes and the beginning of a cycle , against the regime of symptomatic .
and it was a huge revolution .
young men who are at the front of the tank required for a block , hands up , for liberty , for justice , for society .
they matched a mirror of the emotional effectiveness of your face and nonviolence .
they showed a contract that the glue was running from the east to the west and then extended to the south .
and eventually , after six months of the polio and we 've gone through to 50 , 000 people we 've managed to launch our country and put the name of death .
but Saul has left a burden of mark , a professional heritage , corruption and split it .
in the last four decades , the German empire has destroyed the infrastructure as well as the culture and the moral foundations of Libya .
the awareness is destroyed and the challenges , I am also how many other women , and comfort society of Libya , call the comprehensive , and the transition in democracy and social reconciliation .
nearly 200 of the organizations were built in Budapest , during that time and after Mubarak stepped down - - almost 300 meters , it was spent .
after 33 years of skiing , I went back to Libya , and with one single passion , I started to organize my training classes in power , growing people for the leadership skills .
in the same wonderful women , I co - founded the Women Convention for Women International Group that of women , leaders from all different parts of society , to run the corridors for the political empowerment of women and to bring it to peace to do it for us to create a equality .
I was in an incredibly difficult situation of the election , the more and more extreme environment , the more universal view of politics and except .
I led a bright idea from fall of Women Research to run the corridors of a greater general election site , a law that is made to all of the citizens , no matter what they were done , made or the election , and most important is put on those political parties to the party candidates and to bring it across .
so , finally our initiatives have been accepted and successful .
women won 17 , five percent of the Red House in the country 's first elections in the last 52 years .
but once a bit , though , the excitement from the elected elections and of the general revolution goes away - - when we die , we wake up with the news of violence .
and one day we wake up with the news of ridicule and the alert of the Sufi player .
the other day we woke up with the news of the American Soybean Association and were attacked in our pockets .
another day we got up with the news of the troops .
and every day , we wake up with the rule of the Civil Rights and its continuity , and against human rights and shame respect the laws of their laws .
our societies , have been shaped by the revolution , become more polarizing and have left the ideals of freedom , the justice , the society that we have after all .
the notion of things , except and the newspaper becomes the symbol of our time .
I 'm here without intention of being inspired to you with the story of being successful in creating the review and the election .
and I 'm here to admit that we - - the whole country has made the wrong choices , and that 's the wrong decision .
we did not prioritize the civil rights .
because the elections didn 't bring peace , stability and security for Libya .
will this array account and the other lies between male candidates and women have combined peace and reconciliation for the country ?
no , not at all .
so what could it be ?
why do we societies continue to be both richer and dominated by the selfish political climate of dominance and classification , because both men and women ?
the absence of survival is not just the level of women ; it 's the feminine values about compassion , and tolerance , and the full range .
our societies need a national conversation and more built community than having the elections , more warming and divide away .
our societies need more sexual representatives of women from women than they need numbers , and the numbers of sexual intimacy .
we need to stop doing acting like anger , stop support days .
we need to start acting as the representatives of compassion and drill .
we need to develop a female conversation not only the honor but also to practice tolerance instead of hostile , partner instead , the implication , instead of eliminating it .
these were the necessary ideas that a country in which war was devastating , but it was necessary for the use of peace .
because it 's literally a needle , it needs to have culture right now , that intersection between male and female characteristics .
that 's the real allowing .
and we need to create that framework of life before the doing political and social justice .
according to one verse in the Koran 's " craving " - - peace " - - " is the word of God 's highest debt , Pelli . "
then , " artiste " is known " in the traditions of the traditional Abraham has a common origin " with the Arabic voice " - - the symbol of the female - - the sex " where men and women , from all tribes , born .
and because the uterus was full - growing baby in his heart , the sacred way of feeding that entire life .
so we 're taught , " Our Choice " the tens of thousands of things . "
so we 've been told , " Our resource wins the anger .
may each of us be the grace of this compassion .
thank you . Thank you .
five years ago , I stumbled across a little bit like Alice La La Land .
the State schools asked me , a teacher to teach an engineering interaction .
I was scared .
it 's really afraid . it 's the biggest students , big books , and the big ones .
but when the exchange opened , I experienced what Alice so happened when she had fallen in the cave and discovered that the door led to a new world .
that 's just what I feel when I 'm dealing with the students , and I 'm just surprised by the things that they have , and I want other people to experience that kind of gut experience .
I believe that the key to open the door to the world is to be able to communicate well .
we 're incredibly useful communication with scientists and engineers to change the world .
scientists and engineers who are cope with the biggest challenges , from energy to environments and health , and more , if we don 't know and don 't understand that , it 's going to be built , and I believe that we 're not going to take care of it , people who are not specialized , are interacting with them .
but the effective exchange can 't happen if scientists and engineers don 't invite us to where they are .
scientists and engineers , eight stories with us .
I 'd like to share some secrets to make sure we find your science is charming , seductive , sexy .
the first question is : what ?
why did science relate to us .
don 't just tell you that you study the bone tissue , but let 's say you work on the bone tissue , it 's like the parts of the bone that makes you know , because you need to understand the bone marrow , to treat the cancer .
when you describe science , be careful when you use language .
the term is overcome us to understand your ideas .
sure can be said , " Light Helvetica , but why don 't we use " Space and " time . "
to make her idea so clearly not to put them down .
instead , like the English you have , put everything as simple as possible , but not simpler .
it 's clear that he could actually talk about scientific issues without tearing down the idea .
so being asked , for example , to talk , the story , to think , is that the ways to get us and get us interested in what you say .
and as it says , don 't use the stuff as the leading bricks .
have you ever asked yourselves why the " leading brick in the world ? "
what happens when your bricks ? the brick is placed , killed again , and they will kill your talk .
this particular slide here , not only boring it , but is too much on the language of the brain , making us elitist .
instead , this example of this sentence from IMF is actually more productive in action , and it shows the special structure of the strong bone tissue so strong that it will actually be inspired to the novel design of geeks .
and the trick here is to use simple sentences and easy to read audiences if they 're not there , and then use images to give us a deeper understanding of the things that are there .
I think these are just some secrets that will make us open that door and see the present nature of science and technology .
the engineers I work with taught me to sew up everything , so I want to summarize with a equation .
take " science , " except with walking , " the head - down " and " jargon " and then showing " precision , " is to share the relevant explanation for the audience , and then working with " passion " that you have as a profession , then gives the results will be the wonderful link .
and so , the scientists and engineers , when you solve this equation , by any costs , say eight stories with me .
thank you very much .
Hi . I am Cameron , and in the last short time , I 'm a piece .
actually , in 10 years .
and I felt that there was an incredible pressure in the room right now because I shouldn 't wear this dress .
and luckily I carry another piece .
this was the first time people on the TED stage , so I thought you 're very lucky to see this .
if a couple of women were scared when I came out , you don 't have to tell me where right now , but then I would know Twitter .
I realized that I was very lucky to change what you thought about me in the short 10 seconds .
not everybody has the opportunity to do this .
the high heels were really comfortable , and I wouldn 't fit in .
the worst part was this long - sleeve shirt , of course , because you can laugh me , so don 't do anything when it is on my head .
okay .
why do I do that ?
it 's extraordinary .
actually , hopefully it isn 't that weird .
images have great power , but it 's also very , very fake .
I just completely changed what you thought about me in six seconds .
and in this picture , I actually don 't have any boys in my life .
I was so uncomfortable at that time , and the photographer told me to put my hand up on his hair .
and of course , unless the surgery , or rather the artificial eye contact , I had two days ago to photograph , there was very little things that we could do to change our appearance , and look outside , even though it created such an incredible amount of impact on our life .
so today , to me , is not that much " is telling the truth .
and I stand on this stage because I 'm a prototype .
I stand on this stage because I 'm beautiful , white woman , and in the sample , we call it a charming girl .
and I 'm going to answer questions that people have always asked me , but with the truth .
the first question is , how do I become a prototype ?
and I always say , " Oh , I get discovered , but it doesn 't make any sense .
actually , I become the model because I 'm winning the lottery prize , and I 'm the person who 's inherited , and you might be wondering what legacy is .
in the last decades , we have defined beauty , not only for the health and the children , and the balance we 've been programmed for students to desire , but to also be height , musical steps , and white men .
this is the legacy that was built for me and that is the legacy I made with money put on .
I knew there were some people in you that who were there skeptical about this point , and maybe there were some nice food models like , " Wait a second . Arr ! "
I want to praise your prototype . very impressive .
but unfortunately I 'm going to tell you that in 2007 , a Ph . D . in New York University , I statistics are all the models on the ground , and in the piece of humans were employed only 27 percent , less than four percent , not white .
the next question that people ask me was : " can you be the model when you 're growing up ? "
and my first answer was , " You don 't know , you 're not responsible for the recruitment . "
but the next answer that I really want to talk to the girls is , " Why ? "
you know what ? you can become anything .
you can be president of the United States , or the guy who discovered the next Internet , or as a surgical poet , right , then it 's wonderful , because you 're going to be the first person to do it . "
if , after a very interesting list , they said , " No , no , Cameron , you want to be a prototype , " I 'm going to say , " Your boss . "
because she has no power , and she can be the president of the United States , or the President of H & amp ; M & amp ; M , or a future employer .
I said , " You want to be the model when you grow up , like you want to win a lottery ticket when you 're grown up . "
it 's beyond your control , and it 's great , but it 's not a career path .
and I 'm going to prove to you - - I mean , with 10 years of experience as a model of human beings , because it 's not like a heart surgeon , so there 's just a little bit of time .
if the photographer who is here and the light is there , like it 's a beautiful interaction , and when the client says , " Cameron we want this picture of you walking , " ] and it 's this piece across , and this piece is about 400 times later , and this is going to come back , if you 're going to the head .
like this .
hopefully , it 's less than a picture in the middle .
I had no idea what happened at the time .
and sadly after you 've got your education , you write down and do some more work , you can 't say anything anymore , because if you want to be president of your American president , you write down " 10th - year - old CEO model , " people will look at you with weird eyes .
the next question that people ask me is : " are all the photographs correct ? "
that 's right , almost all the pictures are adjusted , but that 's a little element of what 's going on .
this was one of the first photos I 'd ever done , and for the first time , I took a bathroom , and I didn 't even have my menstrual cycle anymore .
I know that we 're going to get into personal , but I am a little girl .
this was my appearance , shot next to my grandmother for months .
this is me in the same day when I took the photo .
my friend came with me .
this is me at a sleep party a couple days ago before we took that picture of France .
this is me with a soccer team in the V .
and this is me right now .
I hope that you can see - - these pictures are not my images .
these are the images that were built , and it was built by a bunch of experts , top - up computer programmers , photographers , photography , and writers and all their funds , today , build money and produce them , and they create this one . not me .
the next question I got a lot of people was saying , " What are you for free ? "
I have a lot of high - heeled shoe - - and I never wore , during the time I got , but the stuff that I got in real life , and it 's stuff that we don 't want to talk about .
I grew up in Cambridge , and I went to the store one time and I forgot the money and they gave me for free a dress .
at the time I was a girl , and I was sitting in a car with a friend who was very scary and she got over the red light , and we were arrested , and all I did was say : " sorry for the police , " and we were able to move on .
I get all those free things out of my life , not because who I am and who I am and who are willing to make money for their appearance , not for who they are .
I lived in New York City , and the last year , we 've been , in 140 thousand teenagers who are being attacked , 86 percent of us are young people .
in New York City , there 's only black and Hispanic people , so for them , the question isn 't , " Am I arrested ? "
it 's " How many times am I going to get taken and when ? "
when I was preparing for this talk , I discovered that 53 percent of all the 13 - year - olds don 't like their body , and this number went to 78 percent when they were 17 .
one last question that people ask me was , " How does it feel like when you 're the model ? "
I think what they want to hear is " If you 're a little bit thinner , and your hair is than you , you 'd be happier and happy . "
and when we were behind the scenes , we gave this sort of thing .
" isn 't it fun to travel , and work with creative people , inspirational and passionate people . "
and that 's true , but that 's only half , because what we never spoke about before the lens , which I never talked about in the tube , is : " I am insecure .
I am insecure because I had to think of my image every day .
and have you ever asked yourselves , " If you 're thinner and your hair is so far , you 'll be happier ? "
you can just meet a sample of a class of people , because they have the largest feet in their mouths and the best parts , and they could be some of the most desolate women on the planet .
when I wrote this talk , I was so hard to figure out the actual balance , because on the one hand , I was so comfortable to say , " I 've got all this stuff because I 'm lucky enough to say , " and I 'm not really bothered to follow the question , " and I 'm not happy . "
but mostly it 's hard to remove a sexual heritage , and the subject of race while I 'm one of the biggest interests .
but I 'm also glad and honored to be here , I think this is luckily I 've come as far as I 've come by 10 , 20 or 30 years , and I 've been working with a lot of companies in my career , because I may not be able to tell you how I 'm working hard , or I 'm not .
if there 's one thing that sticks with this conversation , I hope that is that all of us are ever more comfortable with the power of images in our successful and failure .
thank you .
there are so many different ways that people around us could help improve our lives .
we don 't reach people around , so there 's a lot of intelligence that 's never known , even though we share public spaces .
so over the last couple years , I 've been trying to share more ways to share with my neighbors in public space , using simple tools like paper , make conductive glue , make sure .
and these projects came from questions that I had , like , how much would my neighbors pay for their apartments ?
how can we borrow and borrow more things that don 't we have to type each other 's door in bad time ?
how do we share more than our memories of empty buildings , and we get better knowledge about our views ?
and how can we share more than our hopes for the entrepreneurs that are empty and yet , as our communities can reflect our needs and our dreams today ?
now , I live in New Orleans , and I 'm in love with New Orleans .
my soul is always being coaxed down by the oak tree , covered with those who are love , who have been imagined hundreds of years , and I believe in a city that always creates a place for the music .
I felt like every time someone was sneeze , New Orleans has a procession .
cities has some of the largest architectural processes in the world , but it also has the largest number of what have been discarded in America .
I live near this house , and I think of how I can make it a more beautiful place for my neighborhood , and I also think about something that will change my life forever .
in 2009 , I lost a person I loved .
her name is Joan Crawford , and she 's a mother to me , and her death is surprise and unpredictable .
and I thought about dying so much , and it made me feel so deeply grateful for the times that I have , and give the clarity of what it means for my life .
but I 'm fighting to maintain this perspective in my everyday life .
I feel like it 's easy to capture one day after day and to forget what really matters to you .
so with the help of old friends and new friends , I moved one side of this vacant building , and it looked at it with a loud link - - to - black : " before I die , I want to - - " so that anyone who 's walking by can knock a piece of chalk , their own energy and share .
I had no idea what the test was , but the next day , the wall was completely covered , and it went on .
and I wanted to share something about what people wrote on the wall .
" before I die , I want to try and eat . "
" before I die , I 'd like to get my foot in the beginning of the conversation . "
" before I die , I 'd like to sing for millions of people . "
" before I die , I want to make a tree . "
" before I die , I 'd like to live out of the closet . "
" before I die , I want to give her again . "
" before I die , I want to be an cavalry of some people . "
" before I die , I want to totally be myself . "
so this space has become a creative space , and the hopes and the images of people who make me laugh , the water in my eye , and they 're safe to me during my hard times .
it 's about knowing that you don 't just have your own .
it 's about understanding the people around us in new , creative ways .
it 's about creating spaces for reflect and seeing , and remember what really means to us as adults and change .
I did this project last year , and I started getting hundreds of letters from people who wanted to do a wall wall in their community , so sulfate colleagues and I did a tool , and now we 're transformed in countries from the world , including South Africa , Australia , Australia .
together , we have shown how powerful our public spaces can be if we 're given the chance to have a voice and to share more with one another .
two of the most important things that we have are time and we have sex with others .
in the age of increasing our distribution , it 's even more important than ever to figure out how to sustain a corner and remember that life is short and soft .
death is something that we don 't often have the incentive to talk about or even think of , but I realized that ready for death is one of the most powerful things you can do .
think about death makes your life clear .
our shared spaces could be better to be shared , to things that happen to us as individuals and as communities , and in many ways to share hope , our fears , our fears and stories , that around us can not just help us make better places .
thank you .
thank you .
well , I 'm doing the math reasoning , and this is a different issue for anybody who 's done the math reasoning , and that 's that we 're like the managers consultants .
nobody knew what we were doing .
so today I 'm going to try and explain to you what I do .
well , dance is one of the activities that people do too .
and we love that the buildings that are far off , and there are going to drop in the foot that you will see there .
and he was asking for a special level of expertise and high - tech levels , and could be relevant to this cause .
Unhappily , this disorders like Parkinson 's disease to eventually destroy this unique capacity , as what 's happening to you , I 'm forced to see , to be an educator .
over the past few years have been tremendous progress in the treatment .
however , 6 . 3 million people worldwide have got sick , and they 've got to live in a state of depression , cigarettes , and being other symptoms that go with these diseases , and what we need are the tools for the strong target to detect before they 're too late .
we need to measure progress in an objective way , and eventually , the only way we know when we really have a treatment , is when we have an accurate approach to be able to answer .
but frustrated with Parkinson 's disease and other dynamic disorders , they don 't have a biological mark , so there 's no simple blood - tested method that you can do , and the best thing we 've got to do .
you need to go to the hospital to do it . it 's very expensive , and this is what the trial is out of the clinical trials , which it has never been done .
but what if the patient could do the test at home ?
it would be really free to work to the clinic , and if the patient would commit suicide , what ?
it doesn 't cost a time of gold .
it 's just about 300 dollars , so to do this experiment in the couch , at the magical lab .
so , what I 'd like to offer you is a traditional way , so that we 're able to achieve this , because , as you can see , at least in some direction , we 're all masters of the clumsy house .
here we have a video where the sounds are ringing right here .
and this one is healthy and someone 's saying , and we can see ourselves as these ballet dancer walks together , because we have to match all the facial organs when it 's making sound , and we all have the genes to do that , for example , this origami .
like the ballet is necessary .
I mean , think about how long it took for a kid to say .
from sound , we can actually track the radio position position when it 's vibrating , when the parts are affected by Parkinson 's , the sound agencies are so extreme .
so , at the bottom graph , you see an example of the extraordinary ringing of the sound chain .
we see the same symptoms .
we see the pendulum , the weakest and the soft .
words become more depressed and more voices than later on , and that 's one of the symptoms for instance .
now the sound effects can be really difficult to detect , in some cases , but with any digital anywhere , and use software analysis with the latest machine knowledge , which is really hard to detect , in some cases , we can direct how much people lie in the system , and using just constant power and communication .
so how do trials on this voice compared to the following demo with the clinical trial ? well , you both don 't actually have an aircraft carrier .
the experiment of neuroscience is not an invasion . they 're all used existing infrastructure .
you don 't have to design a whole new hospital to run this experiment .
and they 're both right . but one more thing , the non - verbal experiment .
that means it can happen by itself .
fast pace , only 30 seconds .
the lower cost costs , and we all know what happens .
when something becomes incredibly cheap , it spreads .
so here are some of the great goals that I think we can do right now .
we were able to minimize the problem we needed for it .
it doesn 't have to go to the clinic to verify the discovery .
we can do remarkable things with very high frequencies to get data targets .
we can do the recruitment agent of the huge numbers and the low cost to do clinical trials , which are in the population doing this for the first time .
we have a chance to start looking for the initial ecological footprint of the disease before it 's too late .
so in order to do the first steps towards this , we 're starting to give our place , you know , your name of Parkinson 's voice .
with the tantrum and what we 've been aiming at where voice comes from where there is a very large number of data out where we can get all the data out .
we have the local population who have access to three quarters of the world .
anyone who 's healthy or has Parkinson 's disease that can be called at low cost , and then they 're going to write down sometimes , and I 'm really pleased to announce that we 've got six percent of our targets in just eight hours .
thank you .
Tom Shannon : so , because , to get all the samples for this to be 10 , 000 people to go , you know who 's healthy and who ?
what are you going to tell ?
Max Westerman : yeah . OK . what will happen is , when you have to tell you whether you have a disease or not . right .
see , some people can 't do it . maybe they don 't .
but we 're going to take massive amounts of data collection from all different cases , and the result in different cases is important , because then we look at the actual elements , and we look at the actual evidence of this disease .
so right now is exactly 86 percent ?
that 's more than that .
in fact , I had to praise me , so I had to praise him , because he had just done some amazing work , he 'd have shown that it would have been possible , through the cell phone , that allows this project to be done , and correct .
Forty - nine . yes , a progress move .
so that means that people will be able to have - - All people can call from their mobile phone and do this test , and those who have Parkinson 's disease , they can write their voices , and then doctors can test their progress , see their health situation when they get this disease .
exactly .
thank you very much . Arby 's is everyone .
thanks much , Tom .
I lived in the South area .
this is the south area : the wine store , food fast food .
so city planners come together and they decide to name the South Pole so that it has a different meaning , so they 've changed the south area of Los Angeles , like , in fact , solving some of the problems that are happening in the city .
this is the South Los Angeles .
at the wine store , food is opaque .
like 26 and a half million Americans , I lived in a corner of Los Angeles food desert , home to serve as fast food carts and metal sheets , and dropping off .
and what 's interesting is that food is going to kill more people than an accident and run off .
in South Los Angeles , people are dying of diseases that could be cured .
for instance , the obesity rate of my neighborhood is twice as likely as compared to Beverly Hills , for instance , where about 16 km away .
I was very relieved to see what happens .
and I wondered , how do you feel when there 's no good food out there for the health , when you get out the door in your door , you see the harmful effects that the food system today cause you to live ?
I saw the wheelchair being sold just like the old car .
I see blood vessel centers growing up like Starbucks .
and I realized that had to stop .
I realized the problem was the solution .
food is problems and food are also solutions .
and I was also tired of driving a 45 - minute drive to buy an apple pie did not depend on .
what I did was I made a food forest in front of home .
it 's on a platform of what we called our walk for .
it 's more than 10 meters long , hardbound .
the thing is , that land is in the city .
but you have to keep it .
so I thought , " That 's cool . I can do what I want , because that 's my responsibility and I have to look at it . "
and this is how I look that land .
I was with my crew , the L . A . , and we got together and started planting the food jungle : you know , all nine plants .
we 're a group of people who share a satisfying team , and we 've done it in many different lives , from all different lives in the city , and they 're completely willing , and everything we do is free .
and the gardens , it 's beautiful .
and then there 's the complaints .
the city came to see me , and kind of gave me a writer , and asked me to break the garden . the civilization then turns into it .
and I was like , " come on , really ? "
one of the buildings for planting trees on the soil that people didn 't have any interest to do ? "
and I said , " Okay . come here . "
because this time it 's nowhere .
and then L . A . - - and it was news , Steve Lopez wrote a newspaper on it , and he has to do with the park . and then one of the members of the green soil send an association on Change . org and with 900 characters , we 've been successful .
we had a win in our hands .
that meeting invitation was even called coming up and saying that they spread , and love what we 're doing .
I mean , come on , why not ?
L . A . lead to the United States in terms of the land of the country that ownership city .
they owned 42 , 000 square kilometers of land .
that 's the equivalent of 20 times as a central officer .
it 's enough to grow clearcut with a tomato . .
how can they disagree ?
planting a plant that gives you 1 , 000 , 10 , 000 seeds .
when the green bean is worth a dollar , it gives you the same product to 75 to 75 dollars .
that 's my faith , when I tell people , let 's grow our own food .
plant the product itself is the same .
I had my legacy in the South .
I grew up there . I grew up there .
and I refuse to make part of this reality that is created , but be created for me by some other people , and I 'm making my own reality .
I 'm an artist .
I 'm a garden - - I grew my artwork .
and like an artist , who cars for walls , I , I chose to do the streets of the grass , for a walk .
I 'm using the garden , I 'm grown as a canvas , and the trees and the trees are what I am driving that product .
you 'd be surprised by what the land could do if you put them into the fabric .
you can 't imagine what a fantastic piano looks like , and how they affect people .
so what happened ?
I witnessed my garden being a educational tool , a tool for the transformation of my life .
in order to change the community , you have to change the components of the soil .
we are land .
you will be surprised how the children affected .
gardening is what you can do , especially in your inner city .
and again , you have access to that .
I remember once , there was a mother and a daughter , and there was about 10 to 30 nights , and they were in my garden . then I went out and they were shame .
and I thought , Oh my God , I feel so bad because they 're there , and I tell them , I don 't need to .
well , this piece here is on the road .
I felt embarrassed when I saw that there were people in my neighborhood and still being hungry , and that was less and more the reason that I was doing this . people ask me , " Pam , you 're not going to steal your food ? "
and I said , " Of course , I 'm not afraid they are going to steal .
so they 're way .
that 's the whole idea .
I want them to get them , but at the same time , I want them to get my health back . "
there was another one time when I was working in a homeless neighborhood in Los Angeles .
there were the men , and they helped me to cut nuts from the trucks truck .
the air was so happy , and they shared the stories that the garden had an influence on them and they 'd grown a vegetables with their mother , and then it was amazing to see this idea changing them , even in a split second .
so the green soil has continued to grow about 20 gardens .
we had about 50 people who got to participate , and they were all voluntary .
well , if the kids are really making innovation , they 're going to have a social impact .
if they grow tomato sauce , they 'll eat tomato .
but if nobody ever showed them , if they don 't get the effects of food to their minds and bodies , they 're blind to anything in front of them .
I saw the young people who wanted to work , but they had something to happen , and - - I saw the children who were totally color and they just follow the line , which didn 't lead .
with gardening , I saw an opportunity that we can guide our children in , and there 's a sustainable life .
and when we do that , who knows ?
maybe we will produce George Washington State Washington .
but if we don 't change the components of the soil , we would never do that .
this is one of my strategies . this is what I want to do .
I wanted to grow a garden where people could share a food .
I 'd like to take all the things - - the shipping container , and we make them good at the coffee shop .
don 't get me wrong .
I 'm not talking about something free , because free is sustainable .
what 's interesting about sustainability , is you 've got to sustain it .
I 'm talking about jobs for people , and I pull them out of the street , and let them know their joy , their pride and honor , when you grow our own food , open for farmers .
what I want to do here , we 're going to make it so sexy .
I 'd like all of us to be the green rebel , the dogmas .
we 'll change the concept of " Bladerunner . "
if you 're not a garden maker , you 're not supposed to be in a garden .
Aicha el - Wafi + Soto , right ?
and let 's turn it into your weapon .
basically , if you want to meet me , you know , if you want to visit me , don 't call me if you want to sit on comfortable seat and engage meetings in meetings where you talk about doing this , where you 're talking about making it and stuff .
if you want to meet me , let 's go out to a garden with your shovel and we 're going to grow something .
Hi . thank you .
thank you .
this is where I live . I live in Kenya in the south of the University of Nairobi .
behind me is my father 's orders , and behind the cows , to the Nairobi people .
the Nairobi pilot was not seen in the general area in the south , which means that the wildlife , like the sanitary pad out of our park freely .
and so animals eat as lawyers do later , and this is what the lions do .
they kill our cattle .
and this was one of the cows that had been killed at the night , and when I got up in the morning and I found it dying , and I felt really sad , because that 's the only male chimpanzee there .
my community , a Maasai scholar , believe we have come from heaven , with all our animals , and all the land to keep them , which is why we value them , we are so severe .
so I grew up with the hatred of lions .
the soldiers that protect our community and cattle were also very concerned about this problem as well .
so they kill lions .
this is one of six lions that were killed in Nairobi .
and I think this is the reason that lions in the British Association are very few .
every son between six and nine years old , in my community , is responsible for keeping for the fathers , and I have to do the same thing .
so I had to figure out how to fix this problem .
the first idea I ever got was using fire , because I thought lions do it .
but then I realized that the fire was not really working , because it 's even going to get the lions to see the cows .
but I didn 't quit . I kept thinking .
and my second idea was to use vision .
I tried to fool these lions and put them in the thought that I had been close to the cows .
but lions are clever .
they come to the first day and see the click , and then they come back , but on the second day , they came and said that this wasn 't moving , it was always there .
and then lions hop in and killing animals .
and so on one night , I took a torch between my Buddhist monk , and on that day , those lions do not come .
I discovered that lions have the power of light .
so I had an idea .
since I was a little kid , I worked in my room all day , and I even opened the new radio that owned , and it one day almost killed me , but I 'd learned a lot about electricity .
so I took a battery - - the old car battery - - a box meter - - and it was a little device that was found in the car , and it helped the car model , if they want to turn the left or turn the right thing . it flashes again .
and I got a switch to turn off and open the light .
and that 's a little light bulb from a batteries .
and I put things in .
as you can see , the solar cell has a cost to carry home battery and the battery - - and the battery - - and I call it the computer .
and the clock shows the light switch off .
as you can see , the lights come out outside , because that 's where the lion is coming in .
and that 's how the light goes to lions as they get to the late night .
the light bulb was out and the quantum tricks that made them think that I was walking around the hut , but I was sleeping in my bed .
thank you .
I 've put this in my house two years ago , since then , we 've never met any of the problems with the lions .
our neighbors and neighbors told this concept .
one of them was this grandmother .
she had a lot of cattle had been killed by the cattle , and she asked me if I could build the battery .
and I said , " Yes . "
so I put the lights on , and you can see the back there , and then they 're lions .
so far , I 've been working my seven - family households in my community , and they work .
now my idea was being used all over Kenya to ward off various animal animals like a hyena , and it was also being used in exposing the elephant that was going to work .
because of this invention , I was lucky to get the scholarship in one of the best schools in Kenya , the country where I was really excited about this .
my new school is beginning with funding and raising awareness .
and I even took my friends back to my community , and we put a light bulb for households , and I taught them how to build them .
a year ago , I was just a boy in the area of the support for my father , and I had seen airplanes , and I said to myself that one day , I would be sitting inside of it .
and I 'm here today .
I had the opportunity to come here with an airplane for the first time to participate in TED .
my biggest dream was to be an airplane engineer and grow .
I hate lions , but now because my invention is saving the cows of my father and lions , we can live with lions without any conflict .
GC , in my language , it means thank you very much .
I don 't know how interesting it is to hear my story .
so you 've got this scholarship . yeah .
she 's doing other electricity inventions .
what 's the next invention in your list ?
what is the next invention of my grandchildren , that I 'd like to do , which is the electricity fence ?
I know the fence has been invented , but I want to do my own .
he tried , didn 't , and she - - I mean , I tried it before , but he stopped being hot .
Richard Weller , she was different .
we 're going to force your grandchildren on your path , you 're small .
thank you so much . thank you .
what I did , and what I mostly do with - - my life - - had been locked up in seven years work in Africa .
since 1977 - - to 1977 , I 've got to all sorts of kids - - I 've worked in Zambia , Kenya , the tops of them , mostly in the cloud of technological projects that U . S .
I worked for the NGO of Italy and every project we founded in Africa .
I was so melancholic with my brain .
it 's 21 years old , I think , Italian people , and we 're working well in Africa .
but instead , we kill every single thing we touch .
the first project , which was inspired , for my first book , " The sheer wave of the slump , " was a project in which people decided to teach for food - grown .
so we 're in the South country with seeds from the U . K . in a beautiful valley that has come down to the water and we are taught folks , basically , people , think , peoples , ideas , and the unfortunately , and .
of course the native people aren 't very interested in doing this , so we pay people for them , and sometimes they come .
we were really just really surprised about the locals , in the fatty valley .
but instead of asking why they didn 't grow anything , we just simply said , " Thank you , you 're here . "
" just keep saving people from hunger . "
and of course , everything in Africa is good .
we have these really amazing tomato sauce . in Italy , a tomato sauce bubble point out to this place . in Zambia , it 's about this size .
this is incredible , and we said to the Zambia , " Hey , people who watch if they were so easy . "
while those tomato sauce began to reach , nine , and there are red , just by a night , about 200 galaxies from the waist up and clean .
we said to the people in Zambia , " God , those galaxies just ! "
and people say , " Well , that 's why we don 't grow anything here . "
" why don 't people tell us first ? " you ever ask . "
I thought there 's only one in Italy who 's foolish enough on the ground of Africa , but then as I look at what the Americans are doing , the French people who are doing , and after seeing what they do , I feel some proud of their own project in Zambia .
because , you see , at least we 're eating the galaxies .
you should look at the thing of the crap - - - - you should look at the kind of crap that we have given all these people in Africa shouldn 't be suspicious .
you want to read a book , read " The Tales of Medicine , " written by Dambisa , which was an economist young lady .
the book went out in 2009 .
we , the Western countries that have brought to Africa , two billion United States of Congo , in the last 50 years .
I 'm not going to tell you the damage that was caused .
find her book .
read it from an African woman , the damage that we have created .
and the Westerners , like us , are those who are the U . N . , and we only have two ways to treat each other : or support , or support , or support , or support .
two words have the original source of Latin English , " which means " father . "
they make two different things .
insurance , as I treat anyone from another culture , as if they 're my children . " I love them . "
support , I treat everyone from another culture like my best .
that 's why white person in Africa is called " anagogical " level .
I kind of get in the face of reading the book , " Regenesis , " which is beautifully said , " In all , in terms of economic growth , if people don 't need help , to wear them .
this should be the first rule of aid .
the first rule of aid is respect .
this morning , the person who organized this meeting would put a column out of the floor , and said , " Could we build - - imagine a city that doesn 't mean a new democracy ? "
when I was 27 years old , I decided I worked only to affect people , and I had created a system called Opower , where you 're not going to start anything up , but to be a person who wants to think local , full human , indigenous people who want to be a better person .
so what you do - - you 're quiet .
don 't bring community with ideas , you sit with the local people .
we don 't work from the offices .
we met at our cafe . the pub .
we don 't have any infrastructure .
and what we 've done is we 've become friends , and we 've found what that person wants to do .
the most important one is desire .
you can give someone an idea .
if that person doesn 't want to , then how do you do that ?
the aspiration of women to have on the development of self is the most important thing .
the heavy growth of men for personal growth is the most important thing .
and we made them work for learning , because no one in the world could succeed alone .
people have ideas that don 't know , but the understanding is there .
so a number of years ago , I got this idea : why don 't we , just once , instead , go to a community , and tell people who they should , why don 't we , hear them not , hear them at once ? but not in meetings .
let me tell you a secret .
there 's a problem in community meetings .
entrepreneurs don 't come , and they don 't tell you , at a community meeting , what they want to do with their money , the opportunity they find .
so the plan had this blind point .
the most effective people in your community don 't know whether they 're not there at public meetings .
what we 've done is , at a time - - one and to do that , you have to create a social structure that doesn 't exist yet .
you 've got to create a new class .
a new professional or a family doctor , your family doctors for work , who is sitting with you in your home at the kitchen , at the coffee table , in your coffee room , and helps you find resources to turn your desire into a lifestyle .
I started as a test in Watts , Australia .
I 'm in a Ph . D . , at the time , trying to get away from what was the end of being told , and tell you what to do .
so what I did in the first year of my department was to inform the entrance on the streets , and in the first three days , I had the first client in the car category , called eudaemonia , and I helped him sell fish for a restaurant in Perth , and then we got work together , and then did one of the people who could have shown me ?
and I helped these electron really figure out how to work together and sell these tuna tuna here , not to make a box in 60 apartments , but we found a way to sell them to Japan at 350 dollars to work , and then residents find them up , saying , " Hey , I can you help them .
in a year 's time , I had 27 more or less government project going to ask me , " How do you do it ?
how do you do that - - ? " and I said , " I did something that 's very difficult .
I was silent , and I listened to them . "
so - - - - So the government said to me , " It 's now done . "
we 've done it in 300 communities around the world .
we helped drive 40 , 000 jobs .
there 's a whole new generation of workers who were obviously sick for their own isolation .
Peter Sedaris , one of the biggest management in history , has come through ' 96 , a few years ago .
Peter Attia is a philosophy professor before working with business , and this is what Peter Friedman says : " what the plan really doesn 't like with a society and a business economy . "
the plan is the death in the business .
so now you 're re - engineering the other person doesn 't know what the smartest people in Christchurch want to do with the money of their set - ups .
you have to learn how to get these people to talk to you .
you have to give them private , privacy , you 've got to be really excited to help them , and they 're going , in the crowd of groups coming in .
with a $ 10 , 000 community , we have about 200 consumers .
can you imagine a 400 , 000 people , smart intelligence and aspiration ?
what 's the most sound which you have in this morning ?
the local , the craving . those are the friends who fit the bill .
so what I 'm talking about is the corporations are here where it is currently present .
we 're at the end of the first industrial revolution - - with the fuel sources of stuff and the manufacturing sources , and suddenly , we have these unsustainable systems .
the engine on sustainability is not sustainable .
the road in order to store things is not sustainable .
what we have to look at is how we do to nurture , treat , education , move and contact for seven billion people in sustainable direction .
there 's no technology at all .
who will invent technologies for green revolution ? all the universities ?
government ? forget !
they 're going to be listed , and they 're doing it right now .
there was a great story that I read about in a magazine many years ago .
there is an association which was invited to discuss the future of New York City in 1860 .
and in 1827 , a group of people gathered together , and a predictions about what happened to the city in New York in the next 100 years , and the conclusion is something like this : the New York city will not be in the next 100 years .
why ? because they look at the scale on the chart and say , if the population has grown according to this rate , to move to a population of population of the New York City , they 're going to need six million horses , and that are going to have no way to do that .
they 'd be bathed in horse .
so in 1827 , a thing that they saw a technology which sits at the end of the city in New York has been sort of suspended animation .
so what happened ? in the next 40 years , up to the year 1900 , in the U . S . , there was about a quarter of a car company , which was a car jet .
the idea of looking for a different technology has completely gone up all over them and there 's a very small plant in a bad mood .
Raad Mohiaddin . Henry Ford .
however , there 's a secret to working with entrepreneurs .
first of all , you have to get them some secure .
no , they won 't find it to you .
and then you have to give them an absolute , private and cool service .
and then you have to tell them the truth about business .
the lowest company , the biggest company , has to be able to do three wonderful things that you 'd like to sell , is you have to have a perfect pitch , and you have to have a perfect financial governance .
think about this ?
we never have an individual in the world who has just been able to make , sell it and run money at the same time .
that doesn 't exist .
this character was never born .
so we did a study , and we looked at 100 typical companies in the world at Carnegie Mellon , put down by Plato , all the new company , Google , Yahoo .
there 's only one thing that every single company in the world has , and one thing only : no one company begins with a single person .
we 're now taught business for the age of 16 - year - old age kids in business , and we started in class by giving them the first two pages of Richard disease , and the work for these kinds of 16 - to zero , in the first two pages of Richard Branson or Diamandis .
never has a word " me , " and " us " has 32 times .
he did not start alone .
nobody started a company . no one .
so we can create a community where there are people who have expertise in their small - scale business forms sitting in the cafe , wine , and friends that would present to you that would have made them talk about who is going to need to ask you , " What would you need ? "
what can you do ? can you do it ?
okay , can you sell it ? can you manage money ?
" Oh , no , I can 't do that . " would you like to find somebody else for you ? "
we activate communities .
we have teams that are volunteering to help us with the Richmond State , and we find all the resources and people , and we discovered that the strangeness of the indigenous people , like if you can challenge the culture and economics of the community by tapping into that citizen 's aspiration , your energy and your imagination .
thank you .
and by month third , 2011 , I 've done some research in New York City .
we 're more green creatures .
the lying in the darkness was not windows , and we generally were to avoid the sun .
we tune it to the person who 's thinner , the better skin , the definition of being possible , and we got ever given the articles on the press , but we also have the powerful artists and the understanding of the image and the photography .
in November 2011 , I was tracking the world at home , and I saw the tragic events that happened in Japan .
and then , the volunteer organization I was in in , in a couple of days have come in the school with a break .
I , along with hundreds of volunteers who understand that I can 't just sit idly by at home , so I decided to join them for three weeks .
on May 13 , I found a road to the Richmond town .
it 's a little village in a snake form , with the population of about 50 , 000 people , one of the first places that has been affected by the tsunami .
this sea level is recorded to over 24 meters , and it goes over three miles deep in the land .
maybe imagine , the town was destroyed .
we dragged the fragments from the channel of the hut .
remove the school , door toilets , are ready for innovation and recovery .
we cleaned up the tons of bright individual and smelly caught up from the local fish processing plant .
we rumble the belly , but everyone is happy .
for weeks , our volunteers and residents find something .
they looked for images and pictures and camera and camera alike .
they all did .
they have collected and desks to talk to them in places around their societies .
it wasn 't until that moment that I realized these pictures were actually quite a strong component of the people .
and when they run the waves , they keep the homework , they have left every single , all the things get left behind .
and at the end of the week there , I went to help a walk mall in town .
I helped move the stream hot water in the stream , a huge shower .
and it 's also the place where the sleep center has collected the photos .
this is where people talk about them , and it 's the honor I get , because they trust me to help them wipe the photos from them .
and really the emotion and excited . before , I 'd heard that out of the box , but only if I actually experienced it , it happened .
when I look through the pictures , there are some pictures that have been more than a hundred years old , some of them are still in the envelope of washing rooms , and I think , a photo , I can fix them , and none of them can do it .
so that night , I went to Facebook and asked a few people , and by the morning , I got plenty of positive feedback , and I knew I had to start work .
we started recreating these images .
this was the first one .
they don 't have any damage , but the water is flowing to the girl 's face , to reach out at high accuracy and harm .
if not , the girl in the photo would not look like a baby , and that would be as bad as the image would be broken .
over time , very lucky , a lot of photos are acquired , and we need more modified people , so once again , I went to Facebook and LinkedIn , during the year , I found 80 people who wanted to help from 12 different countries .
in two weeks , I had 150 people who wanted to participate .
in Japan , to July 11th , we expanded the famous towns at the far north of the town .
once a week , we put our laser scanner in the temporary auditorium that made it possible , so people were getting their pictures back .
the older women are sometimes never seeing the scanner , but after 10 minutes , looking for this image of their loss , gave us to scan , put it on a cloud server , to reach back from a stranger , a stranger , somewhere in a world , and started being fix .
time spent mainly in re - engineering is a completely different story , and it obviously depends on the level of the image .
it can take an hour . it can take us all week .
it can take months and months .
the officer in this picture is almost wrapped up in the hands , or gal stripping , from the parts and the detail that has not yet been hurt .
it takes a lot of time .
now , all of these images have been damaged , damaged , stressed out in the saltwater , covered by bacteria , in the water , and sometimes in the oil , they 're going to go on over a large part of the project .
we couldn 't fix it if the images weren 't clean and clear .
we 'd been lucky to clean the image with my hands .
there 's a wonderful local woman who guide us .
very , very preventable for these bad images .
the Minister of Finance - - I said , it 's like having a tattoo for someone .
you 've got an opportunity to make mistakes .
women brought us these photographs and they were lucky , when they got them .
she 's wiping them clean , and stopped when I realized that I was doing it , it was hurt so much more .
you had a copy of this image .
otherwise , places like her husband and faces , will never be able to restore , just maybe put them together in a different image , and to do the entire image .
and when she took some pictures from us , she shared a little bit of our story .
these pictures were asked by her husband to find at a firemen , between the broken pieces on a long way since there was a devastating house , and they realized that he was .
the day after the tsunami , he was responsible for the tsunami .
he had to go in terms of the water when the press signed up .
two little sons , no longer a child , two boys are in school , two different schools .
a child was trapped in the water .
it took about a week off , and she found out that all of them were alive .
the day I took it back to her , and the youngest son of his son turned 14 .
to her , after all , these pictures were the perfect gift for him , something it was able to look back , to remember the past that was not particularly frightened from that March , when the whole life was finally messed up or was destroyed .
after six months in Japan , 1 . 100 volunteers have been involved in the organization in the background , in the hundred people who have cleaned up $ 135 , 000 pictures , most — — in most of them have left with his owner , this is a very important thing .
over the five hundred global volunteers have helped drive over 90 families , hundreds of photos have been completely restore and corrections .
in this time , we didn 't spend too much than a thousand dollars for equipment and materials , mostly for the base of the printer .
we took a continuous image .
every picture suggested someone or something , a place , a relationship , a loved one .
they 're the objects that keep our memories and our story , which is what we end up with will cling and the first thing we 're going back to see .
that 's what this entire project means , to restore the small bits of humanity , to bring connections back to someone .
when this picture is returned , it will create a huge shift in human life .
the project also creates significant differences in the lives of the people who fix the site .
for some people , they 've been connected to something larger , to go to something else , and use their talents for something other than just the 5 - rich and flat model .
I wanted to read an email that would stop this talk : the email from Nagasaki , the ability to photo , to send me back from Japan six months later .
" when I work , I can 't help but think of each individual and the stories that are contained in the photographs .
there was a photo of many generations of women in my house , old - to - kids , walking around a baby , who touched me because I had similar pictures , my grandmother , my mom , my father and my daughter , who was born on the side of the wall .
on the other side , no matter what time , our basic need is the same , right ?
thank you .
I was in the deep depth of Cambodia under a illegal hut in Ghana .
an area of dirt and heat , and it 's very hard to breathe .
I can feel the collision from the authorities , or the use of the darkness , but I can 't see any more .
and I heard the voice , but almost the tunnel is the fun and the laugh that was bent out of the raw stuff .
like people , I wear a cheap battery light up on the head , which was put into an old rubber loop , and I almost couldn 't look out the shadows that was challenged by the walls of a zero - square feet down to the ground .
when I slide my hand , I can remember the new miners who came up with a few days earlier , and was trapped down the tunnel .
as I speak to you today , these people are still deep down in that hole , taking their lives and without labor , and usually dead .
I was thrown out of that hole , and I was home , but they probably would not have come home at home , because I had gotten in a slavery .
in the last 28 years , I 've been collecting local cultural documents in over the last 70 countries on these six countries , and in 2009 , I 've had the most honor of being the only organizers of the social world in Vancouver .
among the amazing talented people I met there , I met someone who was support for the genocide , an NGO member in the pursuit of modern terror .
we start talking about the slaves , and really , I start to see the slaves because I know certain it does in the world , but not that much .
after the talk , I was really horrible and really embarrassing for the lack of understanding of this evil in my life , and I thought , well , how many people would not know what ?
and it started pouring out of spells out , so a couple weeks later , I went to Los Angeles to meet up for the president of the Christmas program and asked them to help them .
and it begins the journey in the modern world .
I came to most of these places .
some places I think of as a house .
but this time , I wanted to see the reality being covered .
an entirely conservative estimation to us is that over 27 million of you are chop suey in the world today .
that 's twice the number of people that have been lifted out of Africa during the course of the Atlantic .
150 years ago , a slave farm was three times the income of a U . S . worker .
that 's 50 , 000 U . S . dollars today .
but today , many generations of families are being arrested through generations with only 18 - dollar debt .
amazingly , the slavery is at 13 billion dollars globally today .
a lot of people are fooled by great education , better job , just to find yourself in a non - serendipitous way , and not escape .
the slavery is now serving for trade , where the slaves create value , but the person who - - they 're known as the dumping .
slavery is almost everywhere in the world , although it is illegal everywhere .
in India and Nepal , I got to a brick in the oven .
this weird visual savanna scene is the way to go into the early Egyptian world , or the cell .
being covered in temperature over 54 degrees Celsius , men , women , kids , kids , all the family , were pouring in the subway and was basically 18 to the top , to 18 loads once , and transported them from the tanks to the miles away .
1876 , it was just because of the stigma and the intensity , and they were falling apart and over again to 16 or 17 hours a day .
there 's no food , there 's no food , and the reason to eat , because the water is so severe that it 's gone .
and it was spreading all around that my camera was so hot that I couldn 't even reach the stop .
every 20 minutes , I had to go back to the wild car to wipe the equipment and let them operate under the heat of their recovery , and as I sat there , I thought , my camera was better than many other people .
going back to the oven , I just wanted to cry , but as a technically speaker next to me and said , " Lisa Harouni , don 't do this . don 't do this here . "
he explained to me that expression of emotion is very dangerous , somewhere like this , not to me , but to them .
I couldn 't help them directly .
I didn 't give them money , nothing .
I 'm not a citizen .
I can put them in their present worse circumstances .
I had to rely on the Christmas edge to actually work in the system to release them , and I believe they could .
for me , there waiting all the way back to the house to really feel pain .
in the Himalayas , I saw the children who had crossed the mountain in the [ mountain ] beginning to be waiting at the street .
the big ones are bigger than the kids that get them , and the kids get them to the top with their leaves using the stick of the stick , the rope and the plywood .
that is too intense to witness .
how can we create this feedstock , and what 's going on , is going to be able to do you ?
some people don 't even know they 're interrupted , and they work at 16 , 17 hours a day , because they know it .
they have nothing to compare .
when this village required for freedom , the foreign domination .
so , these guys don 't have anything , they 're going to die , but the women in the middle of nowhere , and they ask people to stay together , and the people who are in the current campus get their own quarries , so that they can now work their back to you , and work for their own purposes .
we often think of the sexual slavery as we hear from the word " slavery , " and because of this general awareness , I was told I would be hard to work safe in this particular industry .
we have in we have been given by the women who have used to be sexual slavery .
they were taking me down the big ladder of stairs , just to get me down to the dim end .
this is actually not a reservation .
it 's more like a restaurant .
cell restaurants , as have been known in the industry , are the places of forced sexual hangups .
and everywhere there is the small room , where the slaves and the women , and the children and the girls , some are seven years old , and they are giving extra wine and food .
the bedrooms were dirty and dark room were identified by the number of paint on the wall , by the police page and the curtain .
and the man who 's been in favor of a catastrophic abuse underneath the customer .
standing in that dark side , I remember feeling the fear of bursting to come out , and that moment , I had just come to understand what it was like .
there was only one way : the elevator that I went in .
there 's no background .
there are no big windows out there .
these people have no escape , when we mention that difficult topic , to keep in mind that slavery , including the ratio of trade , it happens in where we live .
tens of thousands of people were taken off to slavery in agriculture , and in restaurants , full of me were wrong in my house , and my list was long .
recently , the New York Times reported that from 100 , 000 to 300 , 000 children in America are sold sexual slavery every year .
it 's around us . we just can 't see it .
the textile industry is often thought when I spoke about the slavery .
I went to many villages in India , where more families were slaves in silk trade .
this is a family portrait .
the black hands of the black hand is the father , the green hands and red boy .
they mix up dye in big boxes , and embedded it in that epidemic falls onto their arm , which is really toxic .
my translator tells stories .
they said , " We don 't have freedom .
but still hope that someday we will be left this house and going somewhere else where we will be paid with the dye . "
and that estimate is over 4 , 000 kids are doing slavery at times , until your largest artificial lake in the world .
and for the first time , I went to a second .
I see it as if a family is fishing on the boat , two boys , some are the nicer ones , and again ?
that 's wrong . they are slaves .
kids got taken away from their family , trading and lost , and working and getting stopped working on these boats here , even though they don 't know how to swim .
this baby is eight years old .
it was the shake in our boat to come close , just start to scared of the boat sticking to the same baby .
he was terrified of falling water .
the branches of the smashed glass , usually come into the fishing grid , and the kids are just so frustrated about being forced down into the water to wearing the tongue .
more kids are drowning .
what he missed is she 's arrested to work at the watch .
too afraid of the owner , I don 't dare to run away , and because having a bad opponent , I continue it down with smaller slavery than I manage .
I met these boys at 5 a the morning , and when they 're pulling the last net , they are , but they are working for a single morning .
in the dark , the coldest night .
and we have to note that these nets are so heavy when they 're full of fish .
I want to introduce Kofi Annan .
Kofi Annan was saving from a wet village .
I met him at the support area that organized the Christmas edge of our growing victims .
here I am shower with the water , the old ones with the water to the top , and the great news is , when you and I speak today , Kofi Annan came with their families , and more than that , their children were getting tools to work and keep them safe .
Kofi Annan is a physical project .
what are you going to be if someone stands up and changed her life ?
driving down the road in Ghana , also colleagues in the Christmas edge , and a gentleman you 're part of a burning car , which is an unexpected idea of hitting our car and knocking on the glass .
he told us to follow a thick walk in the forest .
at the end of the road , he urge us to leave our cars , and to make our cars away .
and then just the dim over there , and you say , " Here 's the rub here , here it goes . "
following that path , we draw the line up the boundary , and after about an hour walking in the forest , the traces was deep in the water after the rains , so I put my photographs up in the head when we got down the ladder to the chest .
so after two hours of working , the abnormal entrance was ended up in the empty space , and in front of our eyes was a serial hole , they were filled with slavery .
many women 's back on their back when they recover the gold , and descend through an individual .
the bank was used in the fundraising process .
these guys were taken as slaves in their basement in another area of Ghana .
and when they get out of the tunnel , they get wet .
I still remember looking at the faces of the red , getting up for a lot of people under the ground to 72 hours .
the bunker was hundreds of meters , they 'd climb up the heavy bags to put them on the other side , where the rock was designed for the gold .
and , by the way , the stones are filled with hard people , but when you look closer , there are more lucky enough to work in the harsh conditions , there are also children .
they were victims of vulnerability , disease and violence .
in fact , many of the possibilities of this muscle will eventually be like this one , with T . B . in another couple of years .
this is Birhan , when his father died , he was the guy who walked in that office .
when the guy is lost , you should have the debt of his uncle on his uncle , and were forced to do a slave away from it .
and when I met , he worked 14 years off in the mine , and the wound is the leg you see from one mine in the mine , an injury , which is so intense .
on top of that , Cyclone Nargis , but it 's still arrested working day after that grave .
and yet , he still must have this dream of freedom to go to school with the help of local activists , like the Christmas press , and as it happens , it pops up in the face of some of the strangers that are most unusual , forcing me to fill up with all of the way .
I want to take the slaves out of light .
when I was working in this area , I brought many candles , with the help of the translator 's help , I brought to people who I thought I wanted to look out the story and get out of them , when they and I 'm secure them .
they know their shape would be seen by the people out there , like you .
I want them to know that we 're going to document them , and we 're going to do anything that can get them to change their lives .
I truly believe , if we treat each other as anybody , you know , it 's hard to get a pink record like a crime .
the pictures are not about the body itself . they are about people , real people , like you and me , all deserve equal rights , honor and respect the same in their lives .
there are no day that I don 't think about the wonderful people who are out there , and I have the great honor to meet .
I hope that the images will evaluate a powerful source of the user , the people like you , and hope that power is going to glow , that fire , to reflect on the slaves , because there 's no light , the hell of a prison will be able to live in the dark .
thank you very much .
